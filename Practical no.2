A. Add user 
The add user command is used for user account
for system admin tasks on Ubuntu.

Command for adduser

$sudo adduser user_name


B. Network setting 
network settings is essential when installing
an ubuntu server It is  useful for troubleshooting
problems with your Internet connection.  
In Ubuntu, to set an IP address through terminal commands.
First type netstat –I to find the interface name. 
Then type the below command:

sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.72.6 
netmask 255.255.255.0

Then to add a default gateway,
add the below command:

sudo route add default gw
192.168.72.1 eth0



C. Configure service 

Systemd

sudo systemctl status –shows status of all services on server

sudo systemctl status apache2 – shows status of specific service

sudo systemctl start/restart/stop apache2 – start/stop restart service
Service

sudo service —status-all | less – shows status of services and allows you to scroll through results.

sudo service apache2 status/start/stop/restart – to manage services
Init.d 

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 status/start/restart/stop – to manage services



D. display the list of services which are running 

the systemctl command ,it will display a list of all 
loaded systemd units including services, showing their 
status ( active or not).
To list all loaded services on  system (whether active; 
running, exited or failed, use the list-units subcommand 
and --type switch with a value of service.

systemctl list-units --type=service

OR

systemctl --type=service




E. Change to static ip address
1. To setup static IP address in Debian
$ nano /etc/network/interfaces
Output:
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp 

Change it so it looks like this:
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static 
  address 192.168.0.100
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.0.1
  dns-nameservers 4.4.4.4
  dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8
  
2. Save the file and then edit /etc/resolv.conf like this:
# nano /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 8.8.8.8 # Replace with your nameserver ip
nameserver 4.4.4.4 # Replace with your nameserver ip
3. Restart the networking on your system with:
$ /etc/init.d/network restart  [On SysVinit]
$ systemctl restart network    [On SystemD]

F.Disable ipv6 

to disable the protocol on a Debian-based machine.

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Issue the command sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

3. Add the following at the bottom of the file:

net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1

net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1

net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1

G.Sudo Setting
] Sudo Setting
 It is mainly used for provide commands execution right
for any user or group.
Only root user has execution right for all
commands .
But normal user have limited commands execution rights

To edit sudo configuration file use:
  $ visudo
