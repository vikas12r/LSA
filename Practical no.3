To enable SSH password authentication, you must SSH in as root to edit this file:

/etc/ssh/sshd_config
Then, change the line

PasswordAuthentication no
to
PasswordAuthentication yes

After making that change, restart the SSH service by running the following command as root:

sudo service ssh restart

#To check if the client is available on your Linux-based system, you will need to:

Load an SSH terminal. You can either search for “terminal” or press CTRL + ALT + T on your keyboard.
Type in ssh and press Enter in the terminal.
If the client is installed, you will receive a response that looks like this:
username@host:~$ ssh

Run the following command to install the OpenSSH client on your computer:
 sudo apt-get install openssh-client

you will need to install the OpenSSH server. Leave the terminal open and:

Run the following command to install the SSH server:
sudo apt-get install openssh-server ii.
Type in your superuser password when asked.
Enter and Y to allow the installation to continue after the disk space prompt.
The required support files will be installed, and then you can check if the SSH server is running on the machine by typing this command:

sudo service ssh status

Now edit the SSH daemon configuration file, for example, you can change the default port for SSH connections.
 sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

The configuration file will open in the editor of your choice. In this case, we used Nano.

If you need to install Nano, run this command:

sudo apt-get install nano
We need to restart SSH service every time we make any changes to the sshd_config file:

sudo service ssh restart
Open the SSH terminal on your machine and run the following command:
ssh your_username@host_ip_address
If the username on your local machine matches the one on the server you are trying to connect to, you can just type:
ssh host_ip_address
