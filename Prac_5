Steps 1: To install Samba, we run:
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt-get –y  install samba
We can check if the installation was successful by running:
$whereis samba 
Now start samba service and enable it at startup:
$ sudo systemctl start smbd
$ sudo systemctl enable smbd
Step 2: Configure File Server – Anonymous Share
a. Create a shared folder called “samba_shared”.
 $ mkdir  samba_shared
b. The configuration file for Samba is located at /etc/samba/smb.conf. To add the new directory as a share, we edit the file by running:
$ sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
At the bottom of the file, add the following lines:
[sambashare]
    comment = Samba on Ubuntu
    path = /home/username/sambashare
    read only = no
    browsable = yes
c. Now that we have our new share configured, save it and restart Samba for it to take effect:
$sudo service smbd restart
d. Add user in Samba
$ sudo smbpasswd –a username
Modify Permission
$chmod 777 /home/kali/samba_shared
e. Update the firewall rules to allow Samba traffic:
$sudo ufw allow samba

Step 3: Creating Samba users
To create a samba entry for an existing system user, use the pdbedit command:
$ pdbedit -a kali
The new user will be created in the Samba default user database which is /var/lib/samba/private/passdb.tdb file.
With a Samba user created, we can make the shares available only to authenticated users,
This user can access his resources on Samba server using smbclient like this:
$ smbclient -U kali -L //192.168.1.3
Restart now
$sudo systemctl restart smbd
$sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.3/24 to any samba
Adding rule
Sudo ufw reload
